We have
a
[demo deployed on IPFS](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmSzjWbQkHXthMZBHvqwW6hbAC1RUEKUbdh33Vrb66reqH/).
It uses a websocket connection to our test server on topiq.es. This is a simple
web-chat application which leverages [replikativ](http://replikativ.io) for its
state management.

chat42 consists of two parts, a client written
with [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/)
and [om-next](https://github.com/omcljs/om/wiki/Quick-Start-(om.next)) (react)
that compiles into efficient Javascript, and a server written in Clojure that
brokers communication between peers over a websocket. The server will be
available for node.js soon and is only necessary to ensure a communication
channel.

There is also a [react native client](https://github.com/replikativ/chat42app).

It was initially created as
a
[presentation for ClojureScript](https://github.com/replikativ/chat42/blob/master/presentation.org) in
our local JavaScript meetup.


## Usage

You need to have [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) installed.


### Client development

Just run figwheel and edit `core.cljs` as needed. If the replikativ parts are un clear, also have a look at the [API walkthrough](http://replikativ.io/tut/get-started.html).

~~~clojure
lein figwheel
~~~

This allows you to develop the client in an offline mode.

### Server peer

If you want to persist and distribute the state, run the server with:

~~~clojure
lein run
~~~

The server uses an in-memory backend to allow quick resets, if you want to
persist the data on disk, use a filestore by [commenting out the mem-store instead](https://github.com/replikativ/chat42/blob/master/src/clj/chat42/core.clj#L14):

~~~clojure
(<?? S #_(new-mem-store) (new-fs-store "/tmp/chat42"))
~~~

The web clients will automatically connect to this peer on `localhost`. You can
now open two tabs and the two chat clients will communicate over the server and
update instantly. 

If you want to open the socket on a broader interface,
change
[the uri string](https://github.com/replikativ/chat42/blob/master/src/clj/chat42/core.clj#L11).
This is necessary if you want to connect clients from the local network or the
internet.
